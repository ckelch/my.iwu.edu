<p>Here are some important things to know before you experience your first game.</p>
<ul>
<li>Games are for your student with ID and $6 for adults.</li>
<li>Tailgating is encouraged. Arrive early, break out your portable grill and favorite BBQ dishes and enjoy the ambiance of 3,000+ like minded Titan fans!</li>
<li>&nbsp;Wilder Field (Tucci Stadium) is located behind the Shirk Center where ample parking is available. <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Shirk+Center,+East+Emerson+Street,+B

<li>The Titan band is loud! You may want to sit further away from the west end of the Tucci Stadium (where they are normally located) if loud music is not your cup of tea. Otherwise, enjoy the upbeat music!&nbsp; :)</li>
<li>Can't make it to one of the games? Most home games can be <a href="http://client.stretchinternet.com/client/iwu.portal">viewed online here</a>.</li>
